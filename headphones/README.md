Headphone Project
Welcome to my Headphone Project repository! This project aims to create an engaging and responsive web page that adapts to different screen sizes. Whether you’re viewing it on a desktop or a mobile device, we’ve got you covered!

Features
Responsive Design: Our web page dynamically adjusts its layout based on the screen width. It switches to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.
Stylish Links: Hovering over links will give them a vibrant #FF6565 color, making navigation more visually appealing.
Button Interaction: Buttons become slightly transparent (opacity: 0.9) when hovered or clicked, providing a subtle visual feedback.
